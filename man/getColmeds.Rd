\title{
Calculate the medians of the database.
}
\description{
\code{getColmeds} calculates the median of the samples of interest from the database table. It is used in \code{\link{getLimmaInput}} and it's output can be saved to avoid calculating it multiple times when running \code{\link{get.pvals}}.
}
\usage{
getColmeds(dbfile, tablename, colsubset = c(-1), nonzero = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dbfile}{
Name/location (as character string) of database (usually ".db") file containing nucleotide by sample coverage. 
}
  \item{tablename}{
Name of the table the database contains
}
  \item{colsubset}{
Optional vector of column indices of the input file that denote samples you wish to include in analysis. Should NEVER include 1 (genomic position).
}
  \item{nonzero}{
If TRUE, use the median of only the nonzero counts as the library size adjustment.
}
}
\details{
It is assumed that the first column in the database is called \code{pos} and contains genomic position.  Note that "group" must have the one fewer entries than the database denoted by \code{dbfile} has columns (or, if colsubset is used, one fewer entries than the length of colsubset).
}
\value{
A vector with the column medians.
