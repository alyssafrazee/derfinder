\usage{
  locfdrFit(zz, bre = 120, df = 7, pct = 0, pct0 = 1/4,
    nulltype = 1, type = 0, plot = 1, mult, mlests,
    main = " ", sw = 0, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
  \item{zz}{A vector of summary statistics, one for each
  case under simultaneous consideration. The calculations
  assume a large number of cases, say length(zz) exceeding
  200. Results may be improved by transforming zz so that
  its elements are theoretically distributed as N(0, 1)
  under the null hypothesis. See the \code{locfdr} vignette
  for tips on creating \code{zz}.}

  \item{bre}{Number of breaks in the discretization of the
  z-score axis, or a vector of breakpoints fully describing
  the discretization. If length(zz) is small, such as when
  the number of cases is less than about 1000, set
  \code{bre} to a number lower than the default of 120. The
  tornado package keeps this at its default.}

  \item{df}{Degrees of freedom for ﬁtting the estimated
  density f(z).  The tornado package keeps this at its
  default.}

  \item{pct}{Excluded tail proportions of zz’s when ﬁtting
  f(z). \code{pct=0} includes full range of zz’s.
  \code{pct} can also be a 2-vector, describing the ﬁtting
  range. The tornado package keeps this at its default.}

  \item{pct0}{Proportion of the zz distribution used in
  ﬁtting the null density f0(z) by central matching. If a
  2-vector, e.g. \code{pct0=c(0.25,0.60)}, the range
  \code{[pct0[1], pct0[2]]} is used. If a scalar,
  \code{[pct0, 1-pct0]} is used. The tornado package keeps
  this at its default.}

  \item{nulltype}{Type of null hypothesis assumed in
  estimating f0(z), for use in the fdr calculations. 0 is
  the theoretical null N(0; 1), 1 is maximum likelihood
  estimation, 2 is central matching estimation, 3 is a
  split normal version of 2. The tornado package fixes this
  at 1.}

  \item{type}{Type of ﬁtting used for f; 0 is a natural
  spline, 1 is a polynomial, in either case with degrees of
  freedom \code{df} [so total degrees of freedom including
  the intercept is \code{df+1}.] The tornado package fixes
  this at 0.}

  \item{plot}{Plots desired. 0 gives no plots. 1 gives
  single plot showing the histogram of zz and ﬁtted
  densities f and p0  f0. 2 also gives plot of fdr, and
  the right and left tail area Fdr curves. 3 gives instead
  the f1 cdf of the estimated fdr curve; plot=4 gives all
  three plots. The tornado package allows choices 0 and 1;
  equivalent to \code{plots = F} and \code{plots = T} in
  \code{getParams}.}

  \item{mult}{Optional scalar multiple (or vector of
  multiples) of the sample size for calculation of the
  corresponding hypothetical Efdr value(s). This is not
  used in the tornado package.}

  \item{mlests}{Optional vector of initial values for
  (delta0, sigma0) in the maximum likelihood iteration. The
  tornado package includes these values in an updated run
  of \code{locfdrFit} if they are suggested via warning in
  the first run.}

  \item{main}{Main heading for the histogram plot when
  \code{plot}>0.}

  \item{sw}{Determines the type of output desired. 2 gives
  a list consisting of the last 5 values listed under Value
  below. 3 gives the square matrix of dimension
  \code{bre}-1 representing the inﬂuence function of
  log(fdr). Any other value of sw returns a list consisting
  of the ﬁrst 5 (6 if \code{mult} is supplied) values
  listed below. The tornado package fixes this at 0.}

  \item{verbose}{if TRUE, various messages are printed
  onscreen during \code{getParams}.}
}
\value{
  See the \code{locfdr} manual for returned values.
  \code{locfdrFit} returns the following additional
  elements: \item{yt }{bin heights} \item{mlest.lo }{if a
  warning that \code{mlest} should be used in a re-run of
  \code{locfdrFit}, the suggested first element of
  \code{mlest}.} \item{mlest.hi }{if a warning that
  \code{mlest} should be used in a re-run of
  \code{locfdrFit}, the suggested second element of
  \code{mlest}.} \item{needsfix }{0 if no warning to fix
  the run with \code{mlest} parameters, 1 otherwise}
  \item{nulldens }{a rough estimate of y-axis values for
  f0(x)} \item{fulldens }{a rough estimate of y-axis values
  for f(x)}
}
\description{
  Compute local false discovery rates, following the
  definitions and description in references listed below.
  Exactly the same as \code{locfdr}, but returns extra
  information.
}
\details{
  Generally not used directly in the tornado package, but
  is a workhorse for \code{getParams}.
