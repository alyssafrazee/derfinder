\title{Do SVA on matrix stored in database}
\usage{
  getSvs(dbfile, tablename, group, chunksize = 1e+05,
    colsubset = c(-1))
}
\arguments{
  \item{dbfile}{Name/location (as character string) of
  database (usually ".db") file containing nucleotide by
  sample coverage.}

  \item{tablename}{Name of the table the database contains}

  \item{group}{a 0/1 vector grouping the samples (columns)
  in the database.}

  \item{chunksize}{How many rows of the database should be
  processed at a time?}

  \item{colsubset}{Optional vector of column indices of the
  input file that denote samples you wish to include in
  analysis. Should NEVER include 1 (genomic position).}
}
\value{
  An object of class sva - see help files for sva.

\description{
  Performs surrogate variable analysis on a matrix, usually
  base-pair by sample coverage, so the surrogate variables
  can be adjusted for in later analysis steps.  SVA is
  meant to provide a method to adjust for unknown
  confounders.
